//! The editor window: a menu bar, the ribbon with its tabs, and dockable
//! panels (`layout.rs`): by default the Explorer and Properties on the
//! right, the Console and Assets along the bottom, and the Scene (the 3D
//! viewport) filling the rest, like Roblox Studio.
//!
//! Play runs the game on a copy of the world (see `play.rs`). While it
//! plays, every panel shows that copy. Only the Properties panel can change
//! it (the game's scripts see those changes); everything else is read-only.
//! Stop drops the copy.
//!
//! Open scripts get tabs at the top of the Scene View; clicking the Scene
//! View's own tab shows the viewport again.
//!
//! Where to change behavior:
//! - `app.rs` — the frame, saved settings, and the dock shell
//! - `session.rs` — open, close, Play, Stop, and the unsaved-changes prompt
//! - `edits.rs` — selection, tools, property and style edits, undo
//! - `tree_ops.rs` — insert, duplicate, delete, reparent
//! - `chrome.rs` — menu bar, ribbon, panels, shortcuts
//! - `commands.rs` — the Console panel and what typed commands do
//! - `files.rs` — save, scripts, import, and files changed outside the editor
//! - `assets.rs` — Assets panel drops, prefabs, and imported files
//! - `asset_fixes.rs` — the Asset Check scan and its fixes
