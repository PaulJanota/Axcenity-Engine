# Engine docs

Open **one** file for the task. The pages in this folder that share a name with a topic (`architecture.md`, `scripting.md`, `rendering.md`, `project-and-export.md`) are maps. The detail is in the file they name.

Source and tests win when a doc is wrong. Update the topic file you used.
