# Architecture decisions

Decisions with long-term consequences, so later work doesn't silently reverse them. Write a new ADR from `Templates/ADR.md`; never edit an accepted ADR's decision in place: supersede it with a new one and mark the old one **Superseded by ADR-NNNN**.

**Before changing code that touches one of these, read it.** If a change conflicts with an accepted ADR, say so in the plan or pull request and either fit the change to the decision or propose a superseding ADR for Paul to accept.

## Superseded and changed decisions found in the plans

Earlier decisions that later work replaced. They live in the plans' "Architectural decisions" sections and topic files; this table keeps them visible so nobody re-applies the old one.

| Original decision | Where | Replaced by | When |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mlua` with **Lua 5.4** (vendored) | `plans/axcenity-engine-v1.md` | Luau ([ADR-0004](ADR-0004-Luau-As-The-Only-Script-Runtime.md)) | 2026-10-25 |
| "CI builds and tests all three OSes from Phase 1; a phase isn't done unless CI is green" | `plans/axcenity-engine-v1.md` | Local verification ([ADR-0011](ADR-0011-Desktop-First-Local-Verification.md)) | 2026-11-10 |
| Windows, macOS and Linux as equal targets | v1–v3 plans | Windows and Linux primary, macOS secondary, mobile and web deferred ([ADR-0011](ADR-0011-Desktop-First-Local-Verification.md)) | 2026-11-10 |
| Behavior trees with their own graph editor | `plans/axcenity-engine-v2.md` | One generic node-graph editor for UI Event Graphs and behavior trees (unified plan, "Changed") | 2026-10-25 |
| `.axpkg` needs a new zip dependency | `plans/axcenity-engine-v3.md` | Reuses the pinned `zip` (unified plan, "Changed") | 2026-10-25 |
| File watching by polling, not `notify` | `docs/editor/scripts.md` (earlier) | `notify` events with a polling fallback (I10, PR #9) | 2026-11-10 |
| Hot-patching engine code with `subsecond` and `dx` | unified Phase 26 | Removed; saved scripts keep their state instead ([ADR-0023](ADR-0023-Scripts-Keep-State-Across-Hot-Reload.md), Phase 89) | 2026-11-12 |
| Each host hand-orders its frame from `frame-loop.md` | v1–v3 | One schedule ([ADR-0006](ADR-0006-One-Shared-Frame-Schedule.md)) | 2026-11-10 |
| Reliable network messages and snapshots in JSON | Phase 63–64 | postcard (M7, protocol 10); `Hello`/`Refused` stay JSON | 2026-11-10 |
| Roadmap L1 (typed property slots) "do after M2 and M4" | modernization report | Measured and parked: name lookups ~9% of S10k (PR #59, recorded in PR #87) | 2026-11-10 |
| GitHub Actions disabled entirely | development policy 2026-11-10 | Release tags only, CI by hand ([ADR-0018](ADR-0018-Actions-For-Release-Tags-Only.md)) | 2026-11-11 |
| References name assets by path only | L2 | References may also name the asset ID (`ax://…`), resolved by `Assets::resolve` (PR #78) | 2026-11-11 |
| Scripts only as files under `scripts/`, never in `world.json` | v1 Phase 4 | Scripts may also sit inside objects as `SourceFile` references, usually in `objects/` (G2, PRs #111, #114, #115) | 2026-11-11 |
| No physics interpolation | physics docs | Moving parts drawn between steps (G3, PR #110) | 2026-11-11 |

## Candidates not yet written

Worth an ADR if they come up for change: the RemoteEvent wire and side rules (`sides.rs`), the editor design-system tokens and shortcut table (design-system Phases 1–5), scripts inside objects as file references (G2; `docs/research/scripts-in-objects.md` records Paul's approval), the MCP server's editor-only, job-based shape (`docs/research/mcp/architecture.md`), the Toolbox's central asset directory (G1), and the editor crate split (L6/G11) when it starts.
