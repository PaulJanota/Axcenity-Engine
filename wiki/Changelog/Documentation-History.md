## Open documentation gaps

Found while building the wiki. Fix them in the repository docs (or here), then strike them from this list.

| Gap | Where | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| ~~`docs/architecture/crates.md` has no row for `sim`; the `player` and `editor` rows omit it; `testing`'s listed dependencies are now reached through `sim`~~ | repo docs | Fixed on the wiki's branch (`claude/project-thread-xtwojp`) |
| ~~`repo-gotchas.md` says `unsafe_code = "forbid"`~~ | repo skill | Fixed on the same branch (`deny`, with the debugger exception) |
| ~~L1's measurement wasn't recorded in the repo docs~~ | repo docs | Fixed upstream by PR #87 |
| The modernization report's subsystem map says "clustered lights"; the renderer tiles lights in 2D (`docs/rendering/lights.md`) | repo research doc | Note the correction (research docs are snapshots; a footnote is enough) |
| `docs/rendering/performance.md`'s Baseline says `build_draw_list` 3.3 ms for 10,000 parts; it's 8–9 ms since before `556b72b` (noted in `docs/benchmarks.md`), unexplained | repo docs | Re-baseline or bisect |
| ~~`benchmarks/baselines.json` held pre-#65 Farmhouse numbers~~ | repo data | Re-recorded at `15965da` by PR #70 |
| `documentation/` and `gitbook-docs.yaml` are a placeholder GitBook scaffold (`# Page`) | repo | Remove or populate |
| No wiki page yet for the release workflow's packaging internals, the editor updater and Version Explorer, the cross-engine benchmark harness (`benchmarks/cross-engine/`), the LOD Inspector and `profile_project`/`OverdrawStats` tools | wiki | Add pages when those systems are next changed |
| Per-subsystem deep dives not yet written in this wiki: the UI Designer internals, terrain generation and erosion algorithms, the material graph compiler, the audio mix graph, the plugin API surface, the developer console | wiki | Add pages when those systems are next changed |
| Obsidian follows `#heading` anchors written as GitHub slugs only partly; links still open the right page | wiki | Accepted trade-off for GitHub and agent portability |
