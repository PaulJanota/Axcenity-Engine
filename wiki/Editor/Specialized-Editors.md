# Specialized editors

The editor's tabs beyond the Scene, Explorer and Properties. Each is a module (often a parent file plus a folder) in `crates/editor/src/` with its actions in `app/<name>.rs`; most keep **their own undo** used while the pointer is over the tab. The usability pass of 2026-11-10 (U*, BL*, UD*, AN*, MS* items in `docs/research/usability/`) reworked several of them.

| Tab | Module | Edits | Saves as | Engine side |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Model Studio | the `editor-model-studio` crate (G11) | Meshes: modeling ops, modifiers, UVs, paint, rig, weights, pose | `.glb` + `.meshedit.json` sidecar | `mesh_edit` ([Mesh editing and CSG](../Engine-Systems/Mesh-Editing-and-CSG.md)) |
| Animation | `animation.rs`, `animation/` | Clips (dope sheet, curves, Record), state machines (Blueprint-style), posing, IK | `*.anim.json`, `*.statemachine.json` | `anim` |
| Sequencer | `sequencer.rs` | Cutscene sequences on a timeline (reuses Animation's dope sheet and curves) | `*.sequence.json` | `anim::sequence`, `script::sequence` |
| UI Designer | the `editor-ui-designer` crate (G11) | ScreenGuis on an artboard (anchors, rulers, palette, inspector), Event Graph, Live Preview | world + `ui/*.uigraph.json` | `ui`, `blocks-runtime::ui_graph` |
| Material | `material_editor.rs`, `material_graph.rs` | Material files: values, maps, presets, shading, water, WGSL shader, material graph | `*.material.json` (graph compiled to WGSL in the editor) | `render` surface shaders |
| Blocks / Graph | `block_editor.rs`, `block_editor/graph.rs`, the `editor-node-graph` crate | Block scripts as blocks or nodes | `*.blocks.json` | `blocks`, `blocks-runtime` |
| Behavior Tree | `behavior_tree.rs` | Behavior trees on the node-graph editor | `*.behaviortree.json` | `nav::behavior` |
| Dialogue | `dialogue_editor.rs` | Dialogues | `*.dialogue.json` | `script::dialogue` |
| Data Table | `data_table.rs` | Data tables | `*.data.json` | `assets::data_table`, `DataService` |
| Effect | `effect_editor.rs`, `app/effect_tab.rs` (R17.3) | The selected particle effect: a preview of its own (play, loop, slow motion), each emitter's module stack (Properties' rows, the world's undo), counts and costs; R17.5: a Place backdrop with the place's Lighting and wind, and Lighting-aware presets (`scene::EffectPreset`) added as one undo step | `assets/effects/*.prefab.json` (a prefab) | `scene::Particles`, `render` particles |
| Terrain Studio | `terrain_studio.rs`, `terrain_studio/` | Sculpt, paint, generate, erode, foliage, layers | terrain folders | `terrain` |

## Character Studio

A workspace of its own, opened from the start screen's Character Studio page with no project ([ADR-0031](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0031-Character-Studio-Is-A-Workspace-Of-Its-Own.md)): presets, body, hair, clothing and stage over a live preview of the default humanoid, posed by the engine's `Animators` in a World of its own (`crates/editor/src/character_workspace.rs`). The face tools stay a Game Editor tab for placed characters (`crates/editor/src/character_studio.rs`). Behaviour: `docs/editor/character-studio.md`.

## Model Studio

Phase 55–62: a Blender-like mesh editor inside the engine. Its view draws through `View::use_model`. The Pose test skins exactly as `assets::Posed` does. Phase 90 ("A narrower Model Studio") removed Sculpt mode, retopology and Bake (about 5,600 lines); R15 brought Sculpt mode and Bake (with Make Low Poly) back at Paul's choice, and retopology by hand stays Blender's. R15.1 added seven brushes (Layer, Blob, Scrape, Fill, Draw Sharp, Nudge, Elastic Grab) and the Mesh Filter; brushes stay on the `Sculpt`'s fixed vertices (no dynamic topology), so masks, symmetry and chunks keep working. R15.3 added a Levels of detail fold: each level's triangle count, the ratios Generate LODs uses, Regenerate, Remove LODs and Preview LOD 0–2 (`lods.rs`); the renderer still picks levels by size on screen. R15.4's Edit in Blender launches Blender on the `.glb` with a script (Settings > External tools; `editor/src/blender.rs`); Blender's Save exports it back and the Studio offers to load it again.

## Animation tab and sequencer

One Animation tab follows the selected Animator; **Animate** (`EditorApp::animate`) makes an Animator, a clip and an Animation as one undo step. A linked clip's settings end with **Retargeting** (AP3, `animation/retarget_panel.rs`): how the take plays on the preview model, the rig checks, both skeletons' bone maps (saved as reusable rig definitions) and the clip's retarget profile; the preview and Convert to keys bind as Animators do (`ClipDoc::bind_on`). A keyed clip's settings end with **Cleanup** (AP4, `property_editor/cleanup.rs`): Mirror, Smooth, Reduce keys, Fix loop seam and Re-time. Record turns viewport edits into keys. The Sequencer previews in the Scene view through `SequenceRun::apply`, the same code the Sequence Instance runs; its transport adds play backwards, loop, an In/Out play range and edit points (AP5, `transport::sequence_bar`).

## UI Designer

Lays one ScreenGui out on an artboard (`ui::layout_artboard`), with several selected, drag-to-reparent in the Hierarchy, X/Y/W/H boxes and a beginner-first inspector (usability PRs #44, #48, #52). Its Event Graph tab compiles to the ScreenGui's `EventGraph` LocalScript ([Blocks and graphs](../Engine-Systems/Blocks-and-Graphs.md)).

## Terrain Studio

Tools in Sculpt, Materials and Terrain rows; generation and erosion run as `terrain::job`s on a worker with progress and cancel; foliage is painted from the Assets panel's props and models.

## Shared pieces

- **One node-graph editor** (the `editor-node-graph` crate) serves block Graph view, UI Event Graphs, behavior trees, dialogues and material graphs. Since Phase 91 every graph view (those five, plus the block Graph view and the Animation state machine) draws on one canvas, `editor-node-graph`'s `canvas.rs`: pan and zoom, box select, the same keys (F frames, Space searches, Ctrl+D duplicates, Ctrl+C/X/V copy and paste as text, Delete, Escape), pins, wires, the minimap and notices. The editor's `graph_keys_tests.rs` drives the same keys through all five views.
- **Preview canvases** (`animation::preview::Canvas`) run a small World through `scene` so previews draw what Play draws.
