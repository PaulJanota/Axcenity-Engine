# Axcenity engineering wiki

The engine's persistent engineering memory: what exists, why it exists, how it works, how it performs, and how it should evolve. Source and tests are the final authority; this wiki explains them and links to them. New here? Read the [Wiki guide](Getting-Started/Wiki-Guide.md), then the [Engine overview](Getting-Started/Engine-Overview.md).

> [!tip] For AI agents
> Before changing code: find the system below, read its page and the ADRs it lists, then read the source it names. After changing behavior: update the page, the [Optimization log](Performance/Optimization-Log.md) if you measured something, and [Documentation history](Changelog/Documentation-History.md). The rules are in the repository's `AGENTS.md`.

## Start here

- [Engine overview](Getting-Started/Engine-Overview.md): what Axcenity is, its four hosts, its shape in one page
- [Architecture overview](Architecture/Architecture-Overview.md): layers, boundaries and the big diagram
- [Build and run](Getting-Started/Build-and-Run.md): commands, tools, platform checks
- [System inventory](Architecture/System-Inventory.md): every system with its crate, status and docs

## Architecture

| Page | Covers |
|---|---|
| [Architecture overview](Architecture/Architecture-Overview.md) | Layers, invariants, the main data flows |
| [Repository structure](Architecture/Repository-Structure.md) | What each top-level folder and crate holds |
| [System dependencies](Architecture/System-Dependencies.md) | The crate graph and who may depend on whom |
| [Execution lifecycle](Architecture/Execution-Lifecycle.md) | Startup of each host, the frame, shutdown |
| [Threading model](Architecture/Threading-Model.md) | The main thread and every worker |
| [Memory architecture](Architecture/Memory-Architecture.md) | Arena, IDs, properties, caches, GPU memory |
| [Platform support](Architecture/Platform-Support.md) | Windows, Linux, macOS; backends; deferred targets |
| [Architecture decisions](Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-Index.md) | Every ADR, accepted and superseded |
