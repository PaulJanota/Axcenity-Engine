# Current roadmap

What's done, open, deferred and planned, as of `36bcf356` (2026-11-11). Sources of truth: the modernization report's section 6 (I/M/L items), the engine gap analysis's section 4 (G items, PR #89), `plans/axcenity-engine-unified.md` (Phases 1–93), `plans/axcenity-engine-graphics.md` (Phases 1–38), and the usability, design-system and release-system research. **Planned** means not built; never describe it as existing.

| TC1–TC8 | Team Create (live collaboration; brief of 2026-11-11 §8): design approved ([ADR-0020](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0020-Team-Create-Session-Authority-And-Operations.md), #134); TC1 sync core in `collab` (#140); TC2 editor sync (edit journal, capture, two-editor tests, #150); TC3 network and identity (device keys, invites, TLS WebSocket, `--team-host`/`--team-join`, #154); TC4 interface (roster and presence #156, panel, title bar chip, others' selections #160); TC5 files (content-addressed saves with compare-and-swap, document locks, members' mirror folders, conflict copies; sync core #168, editor #169, every document tab and start-screen Join #170); TC6 reliability (host journal and crash recovery, size and rate limits #175; host epochs, members' recovery files, Recovered Changes, read-only when the host leaves, camera follow, Settings > Team Create, #180); TC7 the self-hosted `axcenity-collab` server (persistence, crash recovery, admin command line); tested on two machines over a LAN with a 5-minute cut, both ending identical (2026-11-12, results in `docs/research/team-create.md` §12; PR #195) | Done except TC8, which C12 replaces |
| C1–C12 | Collaborate (Team Create renamed; Paul's brief of 2026-11-12): audit and plan in `docs/research/collaborate.md`, [ADR-0021](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0021-Collaborate-Tailscale-Live-Scripts-And-Identity-Seam.md); C1–C6 merged (audit, protocol and rename, Tailscale, setup wizard, recovery, scene presence; two-machine tests passed), C7 live scripts (`yrs`) merged; C8 chat and cursors merged; C9 host checkpoints and restores merged; C10 permissions and hardening built (identity seam, budgets per message kind, audit log, security review); C11 performance built (big messages packed with zstd, S10k measured: idle under 0.1 ms, and S10k's load 5.7 → 0.19 s); C12 Django account integration written as a document only (`docs/research/collaborate-accounts.md`) | **Done** (C10 #211, C11 #215, C12 #216); S10k join timing over Tailscale deferred by Paul |

| Priority 4 | GPU-driven drawing, occlusion culling, AI assistant in the editor, Parallel Luau, … | Future, each with a trigger in the gap analysis |

## Competitive development roadmap (Paul's of 2026-11-12)

`docs/research/competitive-development-roadmap.md` carries the G items forward and adds R12–R20 (asset management, build profiles and reports, Model Studio with sculpting and baking back, large worlds, a VFX editor, GI, online services and platforms as documents only). R17's design (D1–D7, stages R17.1–R17.5: curves as `NumberSequence`/`ColorSequence`, the effect asset as a prefab, a module stack before a node graph) is `docs/research/vfx-editor.md`. R15's audit and stages (sculpt brushes and filters, `_COL` collision pieces with MeshPart `CollisionFidelity`, LOD management, the Blender round trip) are `docs/research/model-studio-r15.md`. R18's options and stages (probe overlay, invalid probes, sky light kept apart, placement and real-time GI tiers, beside RT2) are `docs/research/global-illumination.md`. R19's online services architecture (document only; offline by default, one `online` client crate, O1–O9) is `docs/research/online-services.md`. R20's platform research (Android first, then PC VR; web WebGPU-only and later; consoles need platform programs) is `docs/research/platform-expansion.md`. R18.2 marks light probes baked inside walls or the ground invalid, so they stop leaking, and R18.3 keeps the sky's share of baked light apart so volumes follow the sky; R18.4 adds Fill with Probes and real-time GI tiers by preset. R17.1 (curves over life on both particle paths) landed in #284; R17.2 adds spawn shapes and speed over life; R17.2b adds bursts, `VelocityInheritance` and `ShapeInOut` headings, and R17.2c flipbooks. Its section 11 is the living feature matrix against Unreal, Godot, s&box and Unity; section 12 is the order of work with each item's status. Update both when an item lands.

R16's plan for regions and data layers is `docs/research/world-regions-r16.md`: data layers are `DataLayer` objects in a `DataLayerService`, each gathering the Instances with its name as a tag; showing, locking and setting regions aside in the editor is per person; the editor can stream around the camera; and `DataLayerService` parks inactive layers in games (stages R16.2–R16.4, after the Streaming overlay #280). Built: data layers in the editor (#328), Stream While Editing (#331), regions (#333) and data layers in games (#336, `DataLayerService:SetLayerActive`); only PC hand checks are left.

Procedural world creation (Paul's Priority 3 of 2026-11-14) is planned in `docs/research/procedural-worlds.md`: scatter rules inside a Terrain that place plants and props live per chunk on every device (PW1), biomes (PW2), world presets (PW3), roads and paths (PW4), terrain and objects (PW5) and procedural buildings (PW6); for cliffs, caves and overhangs Paul chose heightfield holes plus cliff and cave pieces (PW7), then a spike of voxel terrain (PW8). **In progress**: PW1 scatter rules, PW2 biomes, PW3 world presets, PW4 roads and paths, PW5 terrain and objects, PW6 procedural buildings and PW7 holes and cave pieces are built; the PW8 voxel spike is built and waits on its benchmark on the PC.

R15 is built: sculpt brushes and the Mesh Filter (#317), masks saved (#322), `_COL` collision pieces (#319) and the Collision fold that makes them (#334), the Levels of detail fold (#320) and Edit in Blender (#321).

## Import formats and extensibility (Paul's priority 7, 2026-11-14)

`docs/research/import-formats-and-plugins.md`: OBJ read directly through `ufbx` (P7.1), USD converted to `.glb` on import by an editor-only `convert` crate ([ADR-0027](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0027-Convert-New-Model-Formats-To-glTF-On-Import.md), P7.2), mesh import presets (P7.3), plugin API 3 (P7.4); Alembic deferred until a geometry-cache workflow needs it (P7.5), USD animation later (P7.6), native extensions deferred.

`docs/research/facial-animation.md` (Paul's facial animation spec, 2026-11-14): blend shapes imported (F1) and morphed on the GPU (F2, [ADR-0028](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0028-Facial-Animation-Morph-Targets-On-GPU-And-FaceControls.md)), face profiles and `FaceControls` (F3), expressions, face layers, blinking and gaze (F4), lip sync (F5), Character Studio's Face workspace (F6), facial LOD, profiling and replication (F7). F0–F7 built (PRs #358, #360, #367, #377, #384, #385, #389, #392, #393 F7a facial LOD, F7b replication).

`docs/research/character-studio.md` (Paul's character redesign and Character Studio brief, 2026-11-14): CS1 the smooth stylized default humanoid on CC0 base meshes ([ADR-0030](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0030-Smooth-Stylized-Humanoid-On-CC0-Base-Meshes-With-Mask-Shapes.md)) **done**; CS2 the Character Studio workspace from the start screen ([ADR-0031](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0031-Character-Studio-Is-A-Workspace-Of-Its-Own.md)) **done**; CS3 live customization (`HumanoidDescription`), CS4 face and animation preview, CS5 character files, CS6 polish next.

## Feature plan (unified plan, Phases 1–93)

| Range | Status |
|---|---|
| Phases 1–80 | **Built**; six hand checks need the developer's PC, Mac or two computers, and Phase 80's 4 × 4 km benchmark scene is now built (`axcenity-test --make-streaming`, 2026-11-12; the server's frame on it went 21.9 → 4.2 ms in the container) with its desktop numbers measured on the PC (the plan's "Audit of 2026-11-12") |
| Phases 60–61: sculpting, retopology and baking | **Removed** by Phase 90 (narrower Model Studio, done 2026-11-12, about 5,600 lines out). **Sculpting and baking back** in R15 (Paul's choice, 2026-11-12; Make Low Poly kept for baking); retopology by hand (Poly Build, Snap to surface) stays out |
| Phase 81: lag compensation and replays | **Built** (2026-11-12): server raycasts rewound to where the shooter saw moving parts (`RaycastParams.CompensateFor`, `Tool.LagCompensated`, network protocol 12) and `ReplayService` recordings, `.replay` files, `axcenity-player --replay` and `PlayBuffer` kill cams; recording and watching a replay by hand is checked on the PC |
| Phases 82–88: Android and iOS | **Deferred** by policy; every criterion marked so |
| Phases 89–93: trim and tighten (engine hot-patching out and scripts hot reload with their state kept, like s&box (changed 2026-11-12); narrower Model Studio, one graph canvas, legacy paths, a multithreaded frame) | Phase 89 **done** (scripts keep their top-level locals across a save in Play, [ADR-0023](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0023-Scripts-Keep-State-Across-Hot-Reload.md); engine hot-patching and its `subsecond`/`dioxus` crates gone, `engine-dev` keeps Rebuild and Relaunch). Phase 90 **done** (row above). Phase 91 **done**: the node-graph views, the block Graph view and the Animation state machine draw on one canvas, `editor-node-graph/src/canvas.rs`, with the same keys in all five views; its line-count goal (−800) wasn't met. Phase 92 **done**: project format 6 (`project/src/migrate_shapes.rs`), the legacy readers and the Starter template gone, `animation:Play()` an error naming `LoadAnimation`, and the plan's built part moved to `plans/axcenity-engine-unified-done.md`. Phase 93 **built** (thread "Finish unchecked items in unified plan", 2026-11-12): skeletal posing on the animation pool (`anim/src/threads.rs`, `AXCENITY_ANIM_THREADS`), the Profiler's "Posing by thread" and the crowd bench scene (`axcenity-test --make-crowd`), on top of parallel physics (M3), the renderer's planning pool and the nav worker (M13); its 30% desktop target is measured on the PC. Phase 92 bumps the format to 6, since 5 is the release system's engine record |

Graphics plan: Phases 1–38 built.

## Editor usability and design system

| Work | Status |
|---|---|
| Usability items U1–U20 | **Done** (#31–#56) |
| Design system V1–V26 in six phases | Phases 1–5 **done** (#66 tokens; #71 feedback: errors stay until seen, one way to open and close windows; #73 scale: Explorer and Console draw only what's visible; #74 editing: Properties edits every selected item, Explorer arrow keys; #79 shortcut table, layout presets, Increase contrast); Phase 6 (optional polish) **planned** |
| Universal search (Ctrl+K) with indexed providers | **Done** (#76) |

## Cohesion pass (brief of 2026-11-12)

Audit and plan: `docs/research/cohesion-pass.md` (findings CF1–CF22, phases CP1–CP9), [ADR-0024](../Architecture/Architecture-Decisions/ADR-0024-Shared-Editor-Foundations-For-The-Cohesion-Pass.md).

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| CP1 audit and plan | **Done** |
| CP2 shared UI foundation, start-screen pages, welcome page | **Done** (#229) |
| CP3 documents and saving, open action, script views | **Done**: saving #228, Explorer double-click and Code/Blocks for scripts inside objects #230 |
| CP4 node catalogue and tooltips | **Done** (#231): catalogue and one tooltip card; shared Diagnostic (CW4.3) deferred |
| CP5 Object Viewer | **Done** (#232): one tab for Explorer objects, models, prefabs and materials |
| CP6 physics module split and properties | Done (#233): `physics::api`, drag and rolling friction, ApplyForce/ApplyTorque, momentum |
| CP7 Team Projects, trust, firewall | Done (#234): Team Projects start page, Who gets in (ask the host), narrower listening, firewall check, How Collaborate works |
| CP8 game branding | Done (#235): the manifest's icon and banner with checks, Settings > This project > Branding, the player's game icon, Build Game's `.ico`/`.icns`/PNG, `branding://` paths |
| CP9 final validation | Done: every crate's tests on main with CP7 and CP8 (only the no-audio tutorial test fails in the cloud), clippy, wiki check, snapshot review (the Object Viewer hint now wraps at 260 pt); hand checks listed in each PR |

## Tooling for AI clients and releases

| Work | Status |
|---|---|
| MCP toolkit: `axcenity-editor --mcp` | **Done** ([MCP server](../Editor/MCP-Server.md); #97 design, #102–#109, #116, #119, #123, #127, #130 incl. `--mcp --check` and a user guide) |
| Release system: one version source, release history, tag-only signed draft releases, Version Explorer and update checks, the updater, project format 5 | Phases 3–7 **done** ([Release process](../Development/Release-Process.md); #98, #105, #113, #118, #124, #129). Next release `0.2.0-alpha.1` |

## Deferred by policy (revisit points)

| Capability | Revisit when |
|---|---|
| CI on pushes and pull requests | Architecture and core systems are stable |
| Cross-machine determinism | Lockstep or deterministic replay is actually planned |
| Mobile and web | The desktop engine is reliable |
| Internet-hosted servers, secure netcode (M11) | Local multiplayer and server/client fundamentals are mature |
| Native `vector` as Vector3's representation | Its type-identity and interop checks pass |
